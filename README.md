## Database

If Rails is complaining about authentication to the database, uncomment the user and password fields from `config/database.yml` in the development and test sections, and replace if necessary the user and password `development` to an existing database user.

## Stripe Testing

Use Credit Card # 4111 1111 1111 1111 for testing success scenarios.
